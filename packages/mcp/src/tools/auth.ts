    `Update the authentication configuration for a project environment.

WHEN TO USE:
  • User says "add login credentials", "configure auth", "my app requires login", "update the password"
  • Setting up auth for a newly added environment (after talos_add_environment)
  • Rotating credentials (password changed, new secret key issued)
  • Switching auth provider (e.g. from form to clerk)
  • Disabling auth — set mode to 'none' for public environments

IMPORTANT — get IDs first:
  Call talos_list_projects to see projectId and environmentId before calling this tool.

AUTH MODE GUIDE:
  'none'     — public app, no login. Clears any existing auth config.
  'form'     — standard HTML login form. Auto-detection is always on: Talos finds the login
               page and form selectors automatically. loginUrl is an optional hint — if omitted
               or if the login attempt fails, Talos falls back to base-URL route discovery.
               Provide username and password. Add totpSecret for 2FA/TOTP apps.
  'clerk'    — app uses Clerk. Provide frontendApiUrl, secretKey (sk_test_/sk_live_), email.
               Your app must be configured correctly or sign-in will silently redirect to accounts.dev:
                 1. clerkMiddleware() must be present in middleware.ts (or proxy.ts for Next.js 16+).
                    Without it, auth() always returns null server-side even with a valid client session.
                 2. /sign-in route must render Clerk's <SignIn /> component. Talos lands here, loads
                    Clerk JS, signs in via @clerk/testing, then redirects back to the app.
                    Do NOT make / a public route — unauthenticated users must hit /sign-in first.
                 3. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in in .env.local so auth.protect()
                    redirects to your app's own sign-in page, not the hosted accounts.dev/sign-in.
                 4. Make sure the configured environment URL origin is allowed anywhere your app
                    or identity provider enforces allowed origins or redirect destinations.
               If running against a local dev server:
                 - Use the same base URL a user would open in a browser.
                 - Make sure the app server is reachable from Talos.
                 - Call talos_test_connection to verify reachability before running a browser test.
                 - Create the test user in the Clerk dashboard for your app (not your personal Clerk account)
  'supabase' — app uses Supabase Auth. Provide projectUrl, anonKey, email, password.

VALIDATION enforced before the API call:
  • 'clerk' mode requires frontendApiUrl (URL), secretKey (must start sk_test_ or sk_live_), email
  • 'supabase' mode requires projectUrl (URL), anonKey (non-empty), email, password (non-empty)
  • Each mode only accepts its own fields — mismatches are caught immediately`,
