    `Explore a web app automatically to discover its tests and save them as reusable tests.

WHAT IT DOES:
  An AI agent navigates the app's menus, tabs, and nav bars — mapping every distinct section.
  After the run completes, the discovered tests are saved as named tests visible in talos_list_tests
  and on the Tests page in the Talos UI.

WHEN TO USE:
  • First time setting up a project — "discover what tests exist"
  • User asks "what can Talos test on my app?", "map out my app's tests"
  • After major app restructuring to re-discover changed tests

TIMING & WAIT BEHAVIOR:
  • Discovery takes 2-10 minutes depending on app complexity.
  • Returns immediately with runId and webUrl (non-blocking). Share the URL with the user.
  • If a discovery run is already in progress, returns the existing runId instead of starting a new one.
  • Call talos_get_run later to check status and see how many tests were found.

AFTER DISCOVERY:
  • Call talos_list_tests to see the discovered tests.
  • Run any discovered test with talos_run_test testId="<id>".`,
